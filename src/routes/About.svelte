            My name is Nam Ha aka Zi. This site will contain useful information about my game, and it serves as a place
            I can write some of my thoughts and describe my current work. Currently I work on my game
            <b>Unbounded Perceptions (Up)</b>
            alone. I am trying to keep my skills narrowed down to working on gameplay systems, tools, and the story for
            my game so that I can finish before dying because this story is getting quite long.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is important for me to finish Up because I feel like this is my singular contribution to the world. Of
            course to reach this contribution - to conceive it - I must make day to day contributions to the people
            around myself. To make a great game requires exploring the boundaries of life while staying focused. But it
            also requires never forgetting the times of
            <b>uncertainty</b>
            when we lose track of the road ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now this may all sound silly to you, but the truth you may have forgotten is that basic appreciation and
            basic principles that guide us are the ones that we forget the most, and the ones that are the solutions to
            many of the problems. Although we come up with complex reasons to justify our actions which neglect these
            principles, the truth boils down to if we make the sacrifices to follow fundamental values, things would be
            a lot better. And that's what I want to remember despite feelings sometimes coercing me towards complacency.
            I must remeber the ability I dream of - the ability to make the most out of a few skills. But sometimes it
            seems like a lonely world for those who follow these guidelines.

            And so I present to you Unbounded Perceptions. Its a story where ideas are presented to the player, but no
            ideas are forced. Various characters fall into certain situations, and the player will gain new perspectives
            as the story unfolds and dilemmas present themselves.

                It is lonely to consider feelings and kindness into our actions, but it brings its own strength (or so I
                hope to show in my story).
