# The beginning of sadness despite working hard
Recently I have been quite demotivated, and forcing myself to study on the daily. Despite not seeing anybody I've done a lot of miserable things. I've ignored positivity directed towards me because I don't believe in myself.

# What I've Done

Sometimes this disbelief is a good thing. It lead to me continously study this whole quarantine. I've read a lot of [Professional C++](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-C-Marc-Gregoire-ebook/dp/B07BDFW4PN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=professional+C%2B%2B&qid=1593225089&s=books&sr=1-1). The kindle version is awful but luckily my dad got me a copy since he gets free ebooks as a professor. 

I've also read a book [Apache Spark](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Definitive-Guide-Processing-Simple/dp/1491912219/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2J8NY1OPG5ZN8&dchild=1&keywords=spark+definitive+guide&qid=1593225151&s=books&sprefix=spark+definiti%2Cstripbooks%2C137&sr=1-1). Of course I took notes on everything I read so I have hundreds of pages of notes. I hope they make a new book for version 3.0, but I don't know if I want to read it since I know jobs require you to specialize. I think I'm decent at gameplay development, but maybe they'll look at me going for my Masters in Data Science or reading different books and think otherwise.

I read a [book](https://www.manning.com/books/svelte-and-sapper-in-action) on this web framework which I used to make this site. I also watched this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zojEMeQGGHs) I never thought I would go back into web development. I had to deal with developing sites in C#, Angular, TypeScript, and either MongoDB or a SQL Server Database. I always hated doing web development in the past. I started out doing things in JavaScript, Php, and using  MySQL database. Then one day I worked with my friend on a site where I just focused on developing the backend with Flask. Despite doing so much, I never really understood what I was doing until I read this book on Svelte and Sapper. I enjoyed it a lot, and hope I can get better to make some new tools for my game (and also flesh out this site).

To style my site I learned a bit of using Tailwind. I guess its so intuitive there's not much to learn besides playing around with the styling.

I've done some refinements on my technique as well. I finally got around to reading a book about game design patterns [game design patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/). I write down notes in a word document for every book I read, but I wrote my notes down for Svelte, Sapper, Tailwind, and design patterns in one note.

I've also started doing interview problems again. I hate doing this over making things, but it has to be done someday. I read this book for training my mind to be job oriented [CodeInterviewBook](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/131-5076983-1030828?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=098478280X&pd_rd_r=e84ec971-a550-4600-b397-12eeabbae2d4&pd_rd_w=rx2PV&pd_rd_wg=AaivH&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=E2SDXRWYCBQGYJTBDZ4D&psc=1&refRID=E2SDXRWYCBQGYJTBDZ4D).

I then watched a lot of tutorials. Most of them were on Svelte. I also rounded off some of the gameplay developer skills I was lacking, particularly:
* Concurrent Programming - Read section in professional C++; added multithreading to my game (although it wasn't the most efficient way of doing things I got hands on experience with read-writer locks); added async tasks to my game; used parallel algorithms; and lastly going to finish this section in [Game Engine Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Engine-Architecture-Third-Jason-Gregory/dp/1138035459/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3M6B5LJS1XHE1&dchild=1&keywords=game+engine+architecture&qid=1593225813&s=books&sprefix=game+engine+ar%2Cstripbooks%2C141&sr=1-1).
* Did an entire (course)[https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/] on multiplayer programming and read the UE4 multiplayer programming (notes)[http://cedric-neukirchen.net/Downloads/Compendium/UE4_Network_Compendium_by_Cedric_eXi_Neukirchen_BW.pdf]. I took another (course)[https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealengine-cpp/] but the first course was very comprehensive and even though I may knew more about the language and already had ideas of good design principles in my head, it was until I actually put them into practice when I realized how important it was. The first course started out very slow though (albeit there were a couple details I'd never noticed once in a while), then the multiplayer stuff came and I was hooked.
* Fixed up my own game (to finally release a public demo) and currently working on a massive redesign of my very coupled code into components. This took a shitload of time since I had so many regressions and I had to create a lengthy test plan to cover all the systems I made and abandoned to keep moving forward and learn new things.

I did part of a series of (video tutorials)[https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-with-c/] about testing with Selenium in C# since I was supposed to work as a tester before the pandemic happened. Then I lost my opportunity of a lifetime :(. I also did a tutorial about D3js since I wanted to learn JavaScript for my new job. Even though I lost that website it helped me make this site. I also learned to make graphs for my game (using this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-data-uis-with-d3-firebase/) on D3 and Firebase and [BLUI(https://github.com/getnamo/BLUI)] thanks very much to those who contributed to that great project) :D. I'll upload pictures of that in the game section once I finish making that part of the site.

Last but not least I've been reading this [book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter10/) to automate some things and also watching a course on editor scripts in Python for UE4. Ive already made some scripts with the [UnrealEnginePython](https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython) module, as opposed to the dedicated API Epic provdes for it. I used to use that plugin to do Machine Learning in UE4, but I haven't touched Machine Learning since I had my presentation about generative models last year. 

# Believe in one self or else you'll never appreciate those who care for you

To round off studying a lot I did do sone BJJ training too. I consolidated my notes to keep only key moves I want to spam and I've practiced them as well. I need to review more, but right now it's been hard to focus. I study everyday but definately not at 100% efficiency. I'm losing knowledge. Jobs that are posted require you to do everything.

I just want to find my place in this world. I need to finish Unbounded Perceptions, and I need to learn more and meet new people to reach that point. But right now I'm losing sight of the one thing that was most important to me - Ari Shizuka's ways.

*Kindness that can never hurt is her motto.* But now that I'm feeling down its hard for me to see appreciation around myself, except when its blatant. That shouldn't be the case. The people who silently appreciate us are extremely meaningful. I cannot forget them, so I write this. I will probably forget them in times, but at least I recognize that and I will actively work to remember.
